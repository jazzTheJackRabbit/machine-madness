Experiment,1
Components,1 Force Sensitive Resistor; 5V Power Source from Arduino; 1 multimeter.
Procedure,1. We connected the FSR as a sensor to the Arduino.
,2. We exerted varying amounts of force on the FSR and checked readings on the multimeter.
Results,1. FSR readings were highly inaccurate.
,2. Similar amounts of force resulted in different readings.
,3. We detected a drift in readings upon applying consistent force.
