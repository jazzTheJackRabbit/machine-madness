Experiment,16
Components,2 * Experiment 14 components; Experiment 10 components
Procedure,1. The 2 sets of sensor circuits were connected to the Arduino Uno.
,2. Sensors were attached to shoe in a suitable position
,3. Bluetooth transceiver was connected to the Arduino Uno
,4. Android app was activated and readings were observed
Results,1. We were able to detect the weight placed on the shoe and perform analysis of the same.
,2. We found that the amount of noise had increased to relatively high levels either due to the Bluetooth transceiver or the Arduino
