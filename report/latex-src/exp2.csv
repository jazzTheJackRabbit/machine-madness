Experiment,2
Components,1 Strain Gauge Load Sensor; 1 Multimeter
Procedure,1. We connected the variable resistor of the Sensor to the Multimeter set in resistance mode.
,2. We exerted varying amounts of force upon the Sensor and recorded readings.
Results,We detected a change of 0.1 Ohms upon exerting 15 kg of force.
