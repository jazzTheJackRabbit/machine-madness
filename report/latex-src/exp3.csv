Experiment,3
Components,1 Strain Gauge Load Sensor; 3 51 Ohms Resistors; 1 Multimeter; 1 9V DC Power supply
Procedure,1. The variable resistor of the sensor was connected in the form of a wheatstone bridge with the 51 ohms resistors.
,2. Power was supplied to the wheatstone bridge and Voltage difference was detected across the balance points of the Wheatstone bridge.
Results,Small change in voltage detected ~0.1 milliVolts per 10 lbs of force exerted.
