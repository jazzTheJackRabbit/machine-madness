Experiment,4
Components,1 Strain Gauge Load Sensor; 2 51 Ohms Resistors; 1 Multimeter; 1 9V DC Power supply
Procedure,1. We connected the fixed resistor and the variable resistor of the load sensor as one arm of the wheatstone bridge and the 2 51 Â ohms resistors as the other arm.
,2. We found a voltage of ~2 milliVolts at the balance points with no force exerted.
,3. We exerted varying amounts of force upon the sensor and recorded readings on the multimeter in voltage mode.
Results,We found a steady increase in voltage to the order of the 1 mV per 10 lbs of force.
