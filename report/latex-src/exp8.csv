Experiment,8
Components,Same as Experiment 6; 1 Arduino Uno R3; 4 Diodes
Procedure,1. Sensor circuit is connected to Arduino in Input A0
,2. Arduino script written to display readings
,3. Output was found to possible go out of range with fresh batteries
,4. Diodes were connected as voltage reducers to bring down output voltage to Arduino limits.
Results,5. Arduino can measure the output of the sensor and display it using Arduino script
