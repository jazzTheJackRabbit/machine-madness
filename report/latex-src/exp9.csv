Experiment,9
Components,2 * Experiment 6 components; 8 Diodes; 1 Arduino Uno R3
Procedure,1. 2 sensor circuits were connected as inputs to the Arduino with Diodes acting as Voltage reducers.
,2. Inputs were read at Analog inputs A0 and A1.
,3. 2 Circuits were interconnected to give common ground voltage.
,4. Arduino script to display dual readings was written
Results,1. Successfully read two different serial inputs with a single Arduino.
,2. Large Amount of noise in both circuits.
